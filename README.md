# Build a project every week

In order to increase your coding skills we created this _Weekly Projects_ challenge.

Every week you'll get a new challenge (see table below) that you can complete.

Each challenge will have:

- a description
- a list of user stories (tasks / todos)
- all the resources you need in order to complete

After you complete a challenge, feel free to open a PR and add your own submission inside the corresponding `.md` file of the challenge you are submitting for. The submission should have a link to a live demonstration of your project (you can use: CodePen, Glitch, Netlify, GitHub pages, etc...)
